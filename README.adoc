This “orphan” branch contains the keyring of the Guix project: the OpenPGP public keys of all the Guix committers ever.  It is used to verify signatures on Guix commits.  We only ever add new keys here.

Add your new key with:

[source,bash]
----
gpg --export -a YOUR_KEY_ID > YOUR_USERNAME.key
----
